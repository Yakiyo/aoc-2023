# aoc-2023

Solutions to my adventofcode challenges for 2023. Written in
typescript and using Deno. Not sure wether i'll end up finishing it or
just give up like last year.

## challenges that i forfeited

- day 5 part 2 - cz it runs out of memory and too lengthy

## code

To run a day's code, just do

```bash
$ deno task run <day_number>
```

it should run it.

## notes
While i do try to solve them by myself, but im [grug brained](https://grugbrain.dev), so i occassionally take inspiration from other people's solution, most notably from [didinele's solutions](https://github.com/didinele/aoc-2023), he writes em pretty neatly.
