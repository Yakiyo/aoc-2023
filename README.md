# aoc-2023

Solutions to my adventofcode challenges for 2023. Written in
typescript and using Deno. Not sure wether i'll end up finishing it or
just give up like last year.

## challenges that i forfeited

- day 5 part 2 - cz it runs out of memory and too lengthy

## code

To run a day's code, just do

```bash
$ deno task run <day_number>
```

it should run it.
